<p>
The values that we hold of mission, quality, and community at The Arvizu Brewing Company give us a significant advantage over our competition.
First and foremost, our mission to end modern-day slavery sets us apart as a business. While we are a for-profit business, we are committed to giving at least 10% of our profits to advancing this goal. When customers purchase our product, they join us in that mission. This is a unique opportunity and experience for our customers that sets us apart in the microbrewery industry.</p>
<p>While there are many microbreweries and bars saturating the market, the quality of product coming out of these establishments has noticeably dropped. The Arvizu Brewing Company is committed to quality. Our standard of product well exceeds that of the competition. Our strict quality control procedures guarantee that we will maintain the highest quality in our products over time.</p>
<p>Finally, our focus on our community is a consistent customer draw. We have implemented this central value in a couple strategic ways. First, we have designed our microbrewery location without distractions such as TVs to promote conversation. Second, we engage our community by hosting various community events. Third, we foster a family-friendly environment that encourages a broader and more diverse customer base. Finally, we host monthly dinner parties that brings our community together and engages our community about our mission to end modern-day slavery.</p>
